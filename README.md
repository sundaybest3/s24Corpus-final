## 1. Introduction
This study 
## 2. Literature review

RQ1. How much does the use of passive voice differ between spoken and written materials?

RQ2. Is there a significant difference in the use of the "passive voice + by + agent" construction between spoken and written materials?
## 3. Methodology
Compared the frequency spoken language data and written language data
For spoken language data, scripts of TED video clips are used. The most-viewed TED speeches are refined, mostly delivered by native(-like) speakers. 
For written language data, NOW Sample Data from COCA are used. The Now Corpus is the only structured corpus that shows what is actually happening in language -- virtually right up to the present.  
(1) Spoken data: 
+ 100 Scripts of Most viewed TED video clips from the area of "Communication"
+ Excluded some clips that are of the same speaker, too long, have certain performances during their speech or have more than one speaker.
+ Removed time stamps in the format "00:00" and words that are written in the format of stage directions such as (laughs), (applauds), etc. 
(2) Written data
+ The NOW corpus containing 2916 texts, 1.7 million words of data from web-based newspapers and magazines from 2010 to 2016.
+ Removed unnecessary characters such as "@", <p>, and <h>.
+ Split Text ID from the texts.
