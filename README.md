## 1. Introduction
This study 
## 2. Literature review

RQ1. How much does the use of passive voice differ between spoken and written materials?

RQ2. Is there a significant difference in the use of the "passive voice + by + agent" construction between spoken and written materials?
## 3. Methodology

1) Select spoken and written language data. 
For spoken language data, scripts of TED video clips are used. The most-viewed TED speeches are refined, mostly delivered by native(-like) speakers. 
For written language data, NOW Sample Data from COCA are used. The Now Corpus is the only structured corpus that shows what is actually happening in language -- virtually right up to the present.

(a) Spoken data: 
+ 100 Scripts of Most viewed TED video clips from the area of "Communication"
+ Excluded some clips that are of the same speaker, too long, have certain performances during their speech or have more than one speaker.
+ Removed time stamps in the format "00:00" and words that are written in the format of stage directions such as (laughs), (applauds), etc.

(b) Written data
+ The NOW corpus containing 2916 texts, 1.7 million words of data from web-based newspapers and magazines from 2010 to 2016.
+ Removed unnecessary characters such as "@", < p >, and < h >.
+ Split Text ID from the texts.

2) Find occurrences of passives and passives with agent from spoken and written language data.
3) Conduct a chi-square test of independence to see if there is a significant association between types of text(spoken vs written) and types of passive construction(without agent vs. with agent).
(a) Null hypothesis: Types of text(spoken vs written) are independent of types of passive construction(without agent vs. with agent).
(b) Alternative hypothesis: There is a dependence between types of text and types of passive construction.
